So lets say you want to make custom Live2d models for SDVX

Lets get into the steps

1. Grab your models files and import them to an existing model (Beware that you can't just add this while keeping all the models intact as the Live2D models are hardcoded into the game)
2. Rename the .model3.json to the model you replaced for example "shirakami_fubuki_0100.model3.json"
3. open the .model3 file as you'll need to edit some stuff
4. Grab the "motions" from the original .model3 and import them into your model make sure to remove any motions your model had before
5. If you want to replace the animations I would recommend using one from the game already as external animations tend to break the game
6. Check naming in the .model3 file from your model make sure the filenames are 1:1 with the files in the folder and in the .model3
7. Its time to test if your game crashes when the model loads in try checking the "In" or "Idle" animation and make sure its from the game if it keeps crashing
8. You should be done the model may look a bit weird as you may be using animations for an entirely different model but YOUR MODEL IS IN THE GAME

This should be all you need to do to add a custom Live2D please contact me if you have an easier or more reliable method
